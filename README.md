# FleshWound

## Description

**FleshWound** is a RolePlay addon designed to help you easily manage and track the wounds, scars, and injuries of your characters. For each body region, you can create detailed entries including descriptions, severity levels, and the current state of the wound (e.g., bleeding, bandaged, scarring). The addon provides a visual interface with a body graphic to track the status of each region, making medical roleplay more immersive and easier to manage.

**Shareable Profiles**: Your character's wounds can be shared with other players, allowing for more coordinated and detailed medical roleplay. Keep track of injuries from friends, foes, or NPCs for richer, deeper roleplay experiences.
