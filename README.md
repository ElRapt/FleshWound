# FleshWound

## Description

**FleshWound** is a RolePlay addon designed to help you easily manage and track the wounds, scars, and injuries of your characters. For each body region, you can create detailed entries including descriptions, severity levels of your wounds, and status (bleeding, burned, etc.). The addon provides a visual interface with a body graphic to track the status of each region, making medical roleplay more immersive and easier to manage.

**Shareable Profiles**: Your character's wounds can be shared with other players, allowing for more coordinated and detailed medical roleplay. Keep track of the injuries of your peers in real-time for richer, deeper roleplay experiences.
